*   Admin panel for managing buses, routes, and bookings
*   (Add more features specific to your project)

## Technologies Used
*   **Backend:** Python (Flask/Django/FastAPI - specify which one you are using), MySQL
*   **Frontend:** (Specify if you have a frontend, e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Angular, Vue.js)
*   **Payment Gateway:** Razorpay
*   (Add any other significant technologies)

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
*   Python 3.x
*   MySQL
*   (Any other software or tools required)

### Installation
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/SRBSoriginalthired.git
    cd SRBSoriginalthired
    ```
2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/Scripts/activate
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  **Database Setup:**
    *   Ensure your MySQL server is running.
    *   Create a database (e.g., `srbs_db`).
    *   Execute the `schema.sql` file to set up your database tables:
        ```bash
        mysql -u root -p < schema.sql
        # Enter your MySQL password when prompted
        ```
5.  **Environment Variables:**
    *   Create a `.env` file in the project root directory.
    *   Add necessary environment variables (e.g., database credentials, Razorpay API keys):
        ```
        MYSQL_HOST=localhost
        MYSQL_USER=root
        MYSQL_PASSWORD=your_mysql_password
        MYSQL_DB=srbs_db

        RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=your_razorpay_key_id
        RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET=your_razorpay_key_secret

        SECRET_KEY=a_very_secret_key_for_session_management
        ```
    *   **Note:** Make sure your `.env` file is listed in your `.gitignore` to prevent it from being committed to the repository.

## Running the Application

### Backend
1.  **Activate your virtual environment** (if not already active):
    ```bash
    source venv/Scripts/activate
    ```
2.  **Run the Flask/Django/FastAPI application:**
    ```bash
    python app.py # (Or appropriate command for your framework, e.g., flask run, python manage.py runserver)
    ```
    The backend should now be running, typically on `http://localhost:5000` (for Flask).

### Frontend (If applicable)
[Provide instructions for running your frontend here, e.g., `npm install`, `npm start`.]

## API Endpoints (Optional)
[List important API endpoints if your project is an API, e.g., `/api/v1/buses`, `/api/v1/bookings`.]

## Contributing
[Explain how others can contribute to your project, if you're open to contributions.]

## License
[Specify the license under which your project is distributed, e.g., MIT, Apache 2.0.]
